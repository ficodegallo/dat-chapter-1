My objective in doing this exercise is to learn to read data from a csv file and analyze it in pure Python

PROBLEM: Read in the csv file rock.csv and answer two questions:
1 - How many songs were released in 1981? - solution_3a in the exercise_3a will answer this question
2 - What are the top 20 songs by playcount? - solution_3b in the exercise_3b directory will answer this question
